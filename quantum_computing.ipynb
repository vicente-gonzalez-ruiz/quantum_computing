    "## Some words about [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Mechanics (QM) is the study of matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of atomic and subatomic particles. QM shows that many properties of objects, such as position, speed, and angular momentum, that appeared continuous in the zoomed-out view of classical mechanics, turn out to be (in the very tiny, zoomed-in scale of QM) quantized. Such properties of elementary particles are required to take on one of a set of small, discrete allowable values, and since the gap between these values is also small, the discontinuities are only apparent at very tiny (atomic) scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many aspects of QM are counterintuitive and can seem paradoxical because they describe behavior quite different from that seen at larger scales. For example, the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) of QM means that the more closely one pins down one measurement (such as the position of a particle), the less accurate another complementary measurement pertaining to the same particle (such as its speed) must become. The uncertainty principle shows mathematically that the product of the uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle (momentum is velocity multiplied by mass) could never be less than a certain value, and that this value is related to Planck's constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is[entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement), in which a measurement of any two-valued state of a particle (such as light polarized up or down) made on either of two \"entangled\" particles that are very far apart causes a subsequent measurement on the other particle to always be the other of the two values (such as polarized in the opposite direction). A final example is superfluidity, in which a container of liquid helium, cooled down to near absolute zero in temperature spontaneously flows (slowly) up and over the opening of its container, against the force of gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom that included quantized electron orbits: electrons still orbit the nucleus much as planets orbit around the sun, but they are permitted to inhabit only certain orbits, not to orbit at any arbitrary distance. When an atom emitted (or absorbed) energy, the electron did not move in a continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus to another, as might be expected classically. Instead, the electron would jump instantaneously from one orbit to another, giving off the emitted light in the form of a photon. The electron's wavelength determines that only Bohr orbits of certain distances from the nucleus are possible. In turn, at any distance from the nucleus smaller than a certain value, it would be impossible to establish an orbit. The minimum possible distance from the nucleus is called the Bohr radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger developed the equation that describes the behavior of a quantum-mechanical wave: the Schrödinger equation defines the permitted stationary states of a quantum system, and describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time. Afer a measurement, a wave function \"collapses\" means that a measurement has forced or converted a quantum (probabilistic or potential) state into a definite measured value. For example, before a photon actually \"shows up\" on a detection screen it can be described only with a set of probabilities for where it might show up. When it does appear, for instance in the CCD of an electronic camera, the time and space where it interacted with the device are known within very tight limits. However, the photon has disappeared in the process of being captured (measured), and its quantum wave function has disappeared with it. In its place, some macroscopic physical change in the detection screen has appeared, e.g., an exposed spot in a sheet of photographic film, or a change in electric potential in some cell of a CCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1929, Louis de Broglie won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his prediction that matter acts as a wave (apart from acts a particles). This is known as the Wave–Particle Duality and there is an experiment the [Double-Slit Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics#The_double-slit_experiment)) that show this. In this experiment, the \"quantum\" particle acts as a wave when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1931 Ralph Kronig originated the theory that particles such as atoms or electrons behave as if they rotate, or \"spin\", about an axis. Spin would account for the missing magnetic moment, and allow two electrons in the same orbital to occupy distinct quantum states if they \"spun\" in opposite directions, thus satisfying the exclusion principle. This can be seen in the Stern–Gerlach experiment. The Stern–Gerlach experiment demonstrates several important features of QM:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A feature of the natural world is quantized, and able to take only certain discrete values.\n",
    "* Particles possess an intrinsic angular momentum that is closely analogous to the angular momentum of a classically spinning object.\n",
    "* Measurement changes the system being measured in quantum mechanics. Only the spin of an object in one direction can be known, and observing the spin in another direction destroys the original information about the spin.\n",
    "* QM is probabilistic: whether the spin of any individual atom sent into the apparatus is positive or negative is random.\n",

    "1. A quantum object (for example, a quantum bit (qubit)) is at the same time wave and particle. In fact, qubits operate like waves and are measured as particles. Ideally, the frequency components of the weaves should not change over time, at least without any external influence. However, due to physical issues this is not true and the quantum systems has a feature known as the **coherence time** that quantifies how long the state of the qubits remain measurable. Using the current technology, the coherence time is at most of fome seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At least with the current technology, when a measurement is performed on a qubit, the wave is transformed into a particle (for example, a photon) and some characteristic(s) of the original wave is(are) lost. For this reason, **the qubits cannot replicated**. Remember, to know the state of a qubit, it must be measured, action that \"**collapses**\" the quantum state of the qubit (with a phase and an amplitude) to one of two posibilities, |0> or |1> depending on the distance of the state to such values, with some probability (the measurement is not deterministic). For this reason, the quantum machines must run the algorithms several times to increase the estatistical significance of the results. Notice that we cannot measure the phase of the qubit, only if is |0> or |1> with amplitude 1.\n",
